	Title:	Bad Camper
	Author:	Brad Jones

	Current Version:	1.4.239
	Release Date:			2008-JUL-21

	This plugin will automatically punish players who camp for too long.

	There can be a combination of punishments that get applied to the player.  Punishments
	start when the player's camping meter reaches 80%.  They get worse at 90%.  They finally
	come to a crescendo at 100%.

	This plugin to be the successor to the great AntiCamping Advanced plugin.
	http://amxmodx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=751

	Original design inspiration, many concepts, and code came from "AntiCamping Advanced".

	INSTALLATION

		File Locations:
		
			.\gamemod\addons\amxmodx\plugins\bad_camper.amxx
			
		Modules:
		
			fun (required)
			cstrike (required only if utilizing money reduction punishment)
			csx (required if running Counter-Strike or Counter-Strike: Condition Zero)
			dodx (required if running DoD)
			tfcx (required if running TFC)
			
	
	OPTIONS (CVARs)

		badcamper_punish <iFlags>
	
			Specifies how a player is to be punished when they camp too long.
			A value of 0 will disable this plugin.

			The flags are additive.
			 1: Slap
			 2: Health Reduction
			 4: Sound (set sound via "badcamper_sound" CVAR)
			 8: Blind
			16: Money Reduction (requires CSTRIKE module)
			32: Snark Attack (requires Monster Mod)
			
			The default is 12 (snore and blind).

		badcamper_sound <iFlag>
		
			Specifies the sound to use as a punishment when the "badcamper_punish" flag includes
			the sound punishment.
			
			1: Snore
			2: Heartbeat
			
			The default is 1.

		badcamper_money <iPercentage>
		
			Specifies the percentage of money taken away when a player's meter reaches 100% when
			using the "money reduction" punishment.
			
			The default is 10 percent.

		badcamper_limit <iSeconds>
		
			Specifies the number of seconds a player can camp in one spot before their 
			camping meter will reach 100%.

			The default is 35 seconds.

		badcamper_display <iPercentage>
		
			Specifies the percentage at which the meter is displayed to the player.
			Valid values range from 0 (never show) to 100.

			The default is 1 percent.

		badcamper_show_spec <0|1>
				
				Specifies whether to allow spectators to see other player's meters.
				
				The default is 1, to allow it.			
			
		badcamper_check_all <0|1>
		
			Specifies whether only the team with the current primary objective should be
			checked for camping or if both teams should.
			
			0: only check the team with the current primary objective
			1: always check both teams
			
			The default is 1.
			
			The current primary objective is defined as follows:
			
				- if the map is not a "de" map, the CTs have the primary objective
				- if the map is a "de" map and the bomb hasn't been planted, the Ts have the primary objective
				- if the map is a "de" map and the bomb has been planted, the CTs have the primary objective
				
		badcamper_immunity_flags <cAccessLevels>
		
			Specifies the access level flags needed for a player to have immunity. Immunity is achieved by
			standing completely still and not looking around for approximately 6 seconds.  The camp meter 
			will  still increase until it reaches 65% or more at which time it'll stop until they move or 
			look around again.  If the meter is already at 80% or higher, the meter won't stop.
			
			Set this CVAR to blank to disallow immunity.
			
			For available flags, http://wiki.amxmodx.org/index.php/Adding_Admins_%28AMX_Mod_X%29#Access_Levels
		
			The default is blank (no immunity).
			
			A common value, when admin immunity is desired, is to use the "a" flag (ADMIN_IMMUNITY).
		
		badcamper_start <iSeconds>
		
			Specifies how many seconds after the freeze time ends each round that the 
			meter will start.

			The default is 4 seconds.

			Note that camping is checked every 2 seconds so any value you put in here will 
			effectively be rounded as such.

		badcamper_damage_reset <iResetType>
		
			Specifies if the attacker's or defender's meter gets reset when the player is
			injured by another.

			0: No meters are reset.
			1: The attacker's meter is reset.
			2: The defender's meter is reset.
			3: Both meters are reset.
			
			The default is 3.

		badcamper_damage_restart <iSeconds>
		
			Specifies how many seconds after a player either gives or receives damage that the 
			meter will restart.

			The default is 4 seconds.

			Note that camping is checked every 2 seconds so any value you put in here will 
			effectively be rounded up as such.

		badcamper_health <iHealthPoints>

			Specifies how many points of health to remove from the player every 2 seconds 
			once their meter reaches 100%.

			The default is 10 health points.

		badcamper_allow <iPlayerCount|iPlayerPercent%>
		
			Specifies when a team that is being checked for camping is allowed to camp.  
			A value of 0 doesn't allow a team to camp.

			The default is 0.

			The value can either be expressed as a straight count or as a percentage.
			If the value is being expressed as a percentage, "%" has to follow the value.  
			Examples below.  If the value is a count, players can camp when the number of 
			living players on their team falls to this value or lower.  If the value is a 
			percentage, players can camp when the percentage of living players on their team 
			is at this value or lower when compared to the living players on the other team.

			Examples:

				badcamper_allow 2

					Pretty straight-forward. Once there are 2 or fewer players left alive on 
					your team, you can camp.

				badcamper_allow 40%
				
					More powerful and complex. Once your team comprises of living players that 
					is 40% or less than the number of living players on the other team, you can 
					camp.  For instance (assume your team is listed first) the following match-ups 
					would allow your team to camp: 1v4, 2v5, 3v8, 4v12, 5v13, 6v15.

		badcamper_min_players <players>
		
			Specifies the minimum number of players that have to be connected to the server 
			before players are allowed to camp.

			The default is 0 players.

			This CVAR affects both "badcamper_check_all" and "badcamper_allow" functionality.
			
		badcamper_announce <announcementType>
		
			Specifies how to announce to the opposite team that a player is camping.
			
			0: Make no announcement.
			1: Announce via chat.
			2: Announce via HUD.
			3: Announce via chat and HUD.
			
			The default is 3.
			

	COMMANDS
	
		badcamper list
		
			Lists the punishments in the console and indicates which of them are active.


	CHANGE LOG
	
		2008-JUL-21  1.4.239
		
			! Compatible with AMXX 1.80 or higher only.
			- Fixed issue where the spectator meter would display in the spectated player's language
			  rather than the spectator's language.

		2007-AUG-04	 1.4
		
			- Added CVAR to aid in debugging; allows meter to run when only one person is on server.
			- Removed BugBlatter's "Monster Mod" support. Rationale being that players could crash 
			  your server by typing "meta list" in their console when using it.
			- All snarks are now killed at the end of each round, if using Snark punishment.
			- Fixed discrepancy between documentation and code. Changed "badcamper_announce" CVAR to 
				default to 3, as per the documenation.
			- Fixed issue where HLTV was counting as a player, thus affecting when camping is checked.
			- The camp meter will now affect bots that camp.
				Oh, and if your bot camps, you need a new bot or better waypoint files.
			- Fixed discrepancy between documenation and code.  Changed who can camp (based on 
				objectives)	when not on a map with a bomb site. Changed from everyone can to only Ts can.

		2007-APR-03	 1.3b
		
			- Fixed issue where screen would go sideways if health reduction punishment was used.
	
		2007-APR-02	 1.3a
		
			- Fixed dumb bug that kinda broke everything else. 
				Note to self: Don't make changes right before releasing.
	
		2007-APR-02	 1.3	
		
			! Compatible with AMXX 1.71 or higher only.
			! The 'csx', 'dodx', or 'tfcx' module has to be enabled, depending on what 
				game mod you are running.
			- Added DoD (tested) and TFC (untested) mod support.
			- Made more code optimizations.
			- Defuser's meter will now be paused when bomb is being defused.
			- Planter's meter will be more accurately paused than in previous versions.
				Previous versions would pause the player's meter for the full time it would
				take to plant the bomb, even if they stopped planting in the meantime.
			- Altered method of specifying admin immunity from define to CVAR.
			- Replaced badcamper_immunity CVAR with badcamper_immunity_flags.
			- Fixed overlapping "so and so is now camping" messages.
			- Added option to allow spectators to see players' meters. Default is to show the meter.
			- Fixed meter not always obeying "based on objectives" team. (thanks sasdad and arkshine!)
			- Fixed issue with ATAC 3.x whereas the health reduction could cause a player to get TAs.
	
		2006-MAR-12	 1.2
		
			! Compatible with AMXX 1.70 or higher only.
			! The 'fakemeta' module needs to be enabled.
			- Fixed issue where round end cleanup would not be performed if the round
				was restarted as opposed to ending normally.
			- Fixed "index out of bounds" error.
			- Auto-detects if you're using the supplied "Monster" metamod. If you are using
				a different version of "Monster", reverts to less fine control over snarks.
			- Removed need to recompile if using this plugin in a game mod other than
				Counter-Strike.
			- Removed need to recompile if using the "Snark Attack" punishment. Now, if you
				indicate to use "snark attack" as a punishment, but you don't have "Monster"
				installed, you'll get errors in your log files.
			- Disabled meter when there is only one person on the server. This is useful
				for when you want to sit on your server while waiting for others to join.
			- Implemented more accurate way of detecting if the map was a bomb map.
			- Optimized the code to use less CPU usage.

		2005-DEC-10	 1.1	
			
			- Added "Snark attack" punishment. Requires "Monster Mod" to be installed.
			- Changed "Slap" punishment to increase in power as the meter gets higher.
				Note that when slapped, the player may actually get slapped far enough 
				that it would lower the player's meter.
			- Added "badcamper_money" CVAR to specify what percentage of money to take
				away at 100% when using the "money reduction" punishment. Defaults to 
				10% as was the case before the option was introduced.
			- Added "badcamper_damage_reset" CVAR flag that specifies the meter(s) to 
				reset when a player is attacked. Defaults to both attacker and defender
				having their meter reset as was the case before the option was introduced.
			- Replaced "snore" punishment with "sound" punishment. The type of sound can
				be defined by a new CVAR, "badcamper_sound". There are two types of
				sounds, "snore" (default value) and "heartbeat".
			- Fixed bug where if a player's meter was 100% and the blind punishment was
				being used, when the player attacked or was attacked by another, the blind 
				player would stay blind instead of regaining vision immediately.
			- Added "badcamper list" command that lists available punishments and 
				indicates which are currently active (active as per the badcamper_punish CVAR).
			- Added "badcamper_announce" CVAR flag to indicate how to announce that a player
				is camping and then when the player stops camping. Will announce the 
				name of the camper at 90% and then again when the meter gets below 80%. 
				Options are to print as chat, as a HUD message, both, or neither.
			- Fixed bug where the CVAR 'badcamper_allow' had no effect, thus if set to a
				value higher than 0 a team would still never be allowed to camp.

		2005-SEP-24	 1.0	
		
			- Initial release.
